<h4> Possible solutions to errors </h4>
If you receive an error, or the Python window closes immediately, go through the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have installed all neccessary packages with the pip installer.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have filled in your information in the config.json file correctly (see example nodes file).</li>
  <li>Make sure you have generated a temporary password for your gmail account if you have 2FA enabled: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en.</li>
  <li>if you launch the script via Python: make sure when you launch the Python script, that you are in the correct directory.</li>
  <li>if you launch the script via the .exe: make sure the config.json is in the same directory as the .exe file </li>
</ol>
