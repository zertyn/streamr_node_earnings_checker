<h4><b>Only things to change</b></h4>

- Add your node addresses in the ```nodes.json``` file.
- Optional: add in which interval you would like to loop the script by changing variable ```output_frequency``` in Python file (default = 3600 (seconds), don't recommend going lower than 3600 because the script requests a lot of information).


<h4><b>Uses the following imports/requires the following packages to be installed</b></h4>

- requests
- datetime
- json
- apscheduler
- collections (installed by default on most systems).
- warnings (to suppress an annoying pandas package warning).
- pandas
- tabulate
- colorama
